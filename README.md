### Hi there 👋

### My name is Vladislav

Junior iOS developer.
I understand key patterns and application design principles. I know Swift, I have a basic knowledge of the iOS SDK, the main frameworks (Foundation, SwiftUI, UIKit, Realm, CoreData) and the features of various iOS versions. Familiar with UI architectures MVVM, MVC for iOS applications. I understand the principles of building multi-threaded applications. Worked with application localization.
I am happy to learn new tools for myself that will improve the product and simplify the work. I actively use AI for work and self-study, for example, chatGPT.
I am able to independently search and find solutions for non-standard tasks.
I strive to write code that is easy to read, maintain and develop. I can read other people's code. I quickly get involved in work, easily find a common language with colleagues. I respond well to criticism. I want to join the project team that helps improve people's lives.
